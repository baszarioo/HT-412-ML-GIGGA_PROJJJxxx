				Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without explicit programming. Machine learning can be used for various applications, such as natural language processing, computer vision, recommender systems, self-driving cars, and more. Machine learning algorithms can be divided into three main types: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning is when the algorithm learns from labeled data, unsupervised learning is when the algorithm learns from unlabeled data, and reinforcement learning is when the algorithm learns from its own actions and rewards. Machine learning is a rapidly evolving field that has many challenges and opportunities for the future.

				Machine learning is a fascinating field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and improve their abilities without being explicitly programmed. It has many applications in various domains, such as understanding human languages, recognizing faces and objects, recommending products and services, driving cars autonomously, and more.

				A young computer science student was fascinated by machine learning and wanted to learn more about it. He enrolled in an online course that taught the basics of machine learning, such as linear regression, logistic regression, neural networks, and more. He was eager to apply his knowledge to real-world problems, so he decided to create a machine learning model that could predict the stock prices of his favorite companies. He collected a lot of data from the internet, such as historical prices, news articles, social media posts, and more. He fed the data to his model and trained it for several hours. He was confident that his model was accurate and reliable, so he decided to test it on the next dayâ€™s market. He invested all his savings in the stocks that his model recommended, hoping to make a fortune. However, to his dismay, he found out that his model was completely wrong and he lost all his money. He was devastated and wondered what went wrong. He checked his code and realized that he had made a fatal mistake: he had used the same data for training and testing his model, which resulted in overfitting and poor generalization. He learned a hard lesson that day: machine learning is not magic, and it requires careful data analysis, validation, and evaluation. He vowed to never repeat his mistake again and to study machine learning more seriously.

				Some of the myths are:
				Machine learning is an unnecessary luxury in times of crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. On the contrary, machine learning can be a valuable tool for cost optimization, business continuity, and innovation in various domains, such as healthcare, education, and finance.
			</p>
			<p>
				Machine learning can learn on its own and replace human workers. In reality, machine learning still needs human guidance, feedback, and intervention to ensure its quality, validity, and ethics. Machine learning is not a magic solution, but a powerful tool that can augment human capabilities and intelligence2.
			</p>
			<p>
				Machine learning requires human input and supervision, such as defining the problem, preparing the data, choosing the appropriate algorithms, and evaluating the results12.
				Machine learning is not 100% objective, as it depends on the data, rules, and assumptions that humans provide. Therefore, machine learning can be biased, inaccurate, or misleading if the data is not representative, reliable, or diverse enough23.

			  <p>Of the Curriculum</p>
			  <ul class="lists">
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V1 - 2014</h4>
				  <p>We launched freeCodeCamp with a simple list of 15 resources, including Harvard's CS50 and Stanford's Database Class.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V2 - 2015</h4>
				  <p>We added interactive algorithm challenges.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V3 - 2015</h4>
				  <p>We added our own HTML+CSS challenges (before we'd been relying on General Assembly's Dash course for these).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V4 - 2016</h4>
				  <p>We expanded the curriculum to 3 certifications, including Front End, Back End, and Data Visualization. They each had 10 required projects, but only the Front End section had its own challenges. For the other certs, we were still using external resources like Node School.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V5 - 2017</h4>
				  <p>We added the back end and data visualization challenges.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
				  <h4 class="list-subtitle">V6 - 2018</h4>
				  <p>We launched 6 new certifications to replace our old ones. This was the biggest curriculum improvement to date.</p>
