npx create-next-app
ticket-mods app
after downloading these dependencies: u can open up that folder in vsc.
FIRST Run: npm run dev -> it gives us an html link.
ctrl+shift+~ for terminal :0
then cut everything insidfe the return statement of page.js
"rafce" = shortcut for default page by es7 /react.
ctrl+shift+l -> zaznaczone page można podmienić w każdej linijce.
to simplify routering ,we can just make new folders. example: localhost:3000 = Dashboard page.	and then: localhost:3000/TicketsPage	=> moves to the ticketpage.
And also we can make the folder as: TicketsPage -> [id] (for individual records).
'Semicolons' are optional? i guess so :p
