after downloading these dependencies: u can open up that folder in vsc.
FIRST Run: npm run dev -> it gives us an html link.
ctrl+shift+~ for terminal :0
then cut everything insidfe the return statement of page.js
"rafce" = shortcut for default page by es7 /react.
ctrl+shift+l -> zaznaczone page można podmienić w każdej linijce. 
to simplify routering ,we can just make new folders. example: localhost:3000 = Dashboard page.	and then: localhost:3000/TicketsPage	=> moves to the ticketpage.
And also we can make the folder as: TicketsPage -> [id] (for individual records).
'Semicolons' are optional? i guess so :p
- when folder is in parantheses [], there wont be set up router for that.
In next.js you can use google fonts directly "btw"

Installing free icons lib: npm install @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

	flex-grow: //fill whole page.		overflow-y-auto: //
	
we're setting up css in a file: globals.css [mainly].	//26min
